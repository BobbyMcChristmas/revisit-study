# Introduction

**In this study, we will ask you to interact with the Mapping Global China website and test different functionalities.**

This study will involve two key parts:

- Using your microphone to **“think aloud”** and share how you interpret and make sense of the user interface and experience features. 
- Answering questions that pertain to “navigation” and “understanding” tasks.

Please note that, with your consent, **your audio and screen will be recorded.** Audio and screen recordings are collected so that we can analyze how users navigate and use the Mapping Global China website to guide development. In the following pages, you will complete a consent form.
